# Marketing Campaign Success Predictor
A data science project that predicts marketing success using XGBoost model.

## Abstract
Businesses are relying heavily on marketing to grow and hence need to evaluate their marketing strategies to get better responses from customers. Machine learning techniques are widely being adopted to perform data-driven predictions for the success rate of these marketing campaigns. This study uses the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to predict the likelihood of the marketing campaign’s success based on various complex customer and product factors. To improve the prediction accuracy, the suggested framework combines feature engineering and ensemble learning methods. Important contributing aspects are methodically examined, including customer annual income, age, credit score, product type, product price range, advertisement intensity, and discount levels. And new metrics to further assess the hidden factors behind customers responses, like the affordability ratio amongst a few others are feature engineered. The model is trained and verified on a synthesized and balanced dataset to simulate real campaign conditions. The model has achieved an accuracy score of 0.8300. The proposed model helps businesses make reliable prediction across different and complex factors that affect customer response and boost their marketing performance and hence overall business.
